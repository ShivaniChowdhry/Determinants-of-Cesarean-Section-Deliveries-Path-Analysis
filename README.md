Topic: Determinants of Cesarean Section Deliveries in India: A Path Analysis/Structural Equation Modeling Approach

**Project Overview:** This project delves into the factors influencing the likelihood of Cesarean Section (CS) deliveries in India, using data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4). Focusing on the alarming rise in CS rates, particularly in private healthcare settings, the study employs Generalized Structural Equation Modeling (GSEM) to explore the direct and indirect effects of socioeconomic and maternal care quality factors on the mode of delivery.

**Objectives:**

1. To analyze the impact of healthcare quality and socioeconomic status on the likelihood of CS deliveries.
2. To determine the role of private versus public healthcare facilities in the prevalence of CS deliveries.

**Methodology:** Utilizing data from over 699,686 recent births across India, the project constructs a pathway model that includes:

**Latent Variables:** Quality of maternal care and socioeconomic factors.

**Observed Variables:** Urban-rural status, wealth status, insurance status, and more.

**Model Estimation:** The analysis was carried out using GSEM in STATA, which allows for complex models involving multiple dependent variable types and interactions.

**Results:** Initial models indicated significant positive effects of socioeconomic factors on the choice of private healthcare facilities, which in turn were strongly linked to higher CS rates. However, convergence issues in more complex models suggested the need for model simplification. 

**Key Insights:**

1. Socioeconomic status and the quality of maternal care significantly influence the likelihood of opting for a CS delivery, especially in private healthcare settings.
2. The direct pathway from delivery location (private healthcare facilities) to CS delivery is robust and significant, highlighting the critical role of healthcare facility type in delivery method decisions.

The findings underscore the complexity of healthcare decisions and the substantial impact of healthcare facility types on delivery methods. These insights are crucial for policymakers aiming to regulate and improve maternal healthcare services in India.

**Future Directions:** Further research could refine the models to better understand the interactions between different factors and their impact on delivery methods, potentially influencing healthcare policy and practice in developing countries.
